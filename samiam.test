SAY ! 
I LIKE GREEN EGGS AND HAM !
I DO ! 
I LIKE THEM, SAM I AM !
AND I WOULD EAT THEM IN A BOAT .
AND I WOULD EAT THEM WITH A GOAT .
AND I WILL EAT THEM, IN THE RAIN .
AND IN THE DARK .
AND ON A TRAIN .
AND IN A CAR .
AND IN A TREE .
THEY ARE SO GOOD, SO GOOD, YOU SEE !
SO I WILL EAT THEM IN A BOX .
AND I WILL EAT THEM WITH A FOX .
AND I WILL EAT THEM IN A HOUSE .
AND I WILL EAT THEM WITH A MOUSE .
AND I WILL EAT THEM HERE AND THERE .
SAY ! 
I WILL EAT THEM ANYWHERE !
I DO SO LIKE GREEN EGGS AND HAM !
THANK YOU !
THANK YOU, SAM I AM .
