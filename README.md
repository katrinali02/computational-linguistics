# Project Description
Used word vectors to calculate semantic similarity for word similarity, analogies, and sentence similarity. Utilized 50-dimensional GloVe vectors pretrained on Wikipedia for these tasks. The first task involved implementing vector norm, cosine similarity, and most similar word functions in an `Embeddings` class. The second task involved comparing word embeddings against human judgments using the WordSim-353 and SimLex-999 datasets. The third task involved generating sentence embeddings through simple and weighted sums to assess semantic textual similarity. SAT analogy questions were solved in the fourth task using cosine similarity and parallelism methods to evaluate word vector quality. Qualitative analysis of the findings documented in the provided `qualitative_notes.txt` file.
