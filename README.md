# Project Description

Implement a bag-of-words Naive Bayes classifier with Laplace smoothing and evaluate its performance using precision, recall, and F1 score on a text message dataset from the Haiti Earthquake. The goal is to classify messages as either requesting help (relevant) or not (irrelevant), inspired by the Mission 4636 crowdsourcing project.
