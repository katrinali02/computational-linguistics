# Project Description

Implemented the minimum edit distance algorithm. The code includes functions for calculating edit distances, deletions, insertions, and substitutions, with costs defined as Levenshtein distances. Tested the program by running `python edit_distance.py word1 word2` to see the calculated edit distance between two words.
