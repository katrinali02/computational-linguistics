# Project Description
Implemented the PMI metric to measure word or phrase associations and applied it to the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, which pairs human-generated sentences with entailment labels. The SNLI dataset includes premises and hypotheses labeled as entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Using a PMICalculator class, the project reads data, preprocesses it into dictionaries, and calculates pointwise mutual information (PMI) for word associations.

Investigated potential biases in the SNLI dataset and documented findings, exploring identity-based biases using provided identity terms. The final analyses were conducted on the larger training set to reflect real-world model training scenarios.
